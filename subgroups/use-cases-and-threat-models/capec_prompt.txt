Threat Modeling Prompt (CAPEC / CWE focused)

You are performing a structured threat-model mapping using MITRE CAPEC and CWE.

Scenario:

[SUPPLY THREAT SCENARIO]

Instructions:

First, restate the assumed attack flow step by step, explicitly stating:

attacker role (vendor / insider / external),

delivery mechanism (model update, dependency, plugin release),

what is modified (model weights, training data, runtime behavior),

how the malicious behavior is triggered (latent prompt, condition, time, input).

Then map the scenario using the following required structure and headers:

the attacker’s strategy (distribution + deception + supply chain)
→ list only CAPECs describing how the attacker succeeds

the execution and impact
→ list CAPECs describing what the malicious logic does at runtime

the underlying trust failure
→ list CWEs describing why the system allowed this to happen

Prefer the most specific CAPECs available (e.g., malicious logic insertion, third‑party component inclusion) and avoid defaulting to broad categories unless necessary.

If a more general CAPEC is included, justify why a more specific one does not apply.

Explicitly consider and either include or reject the following classes where relevant:

supply‑chain compromise,

malicious logic insertion,

backdoor / hidden functionality,

data or instruction manipulation,

execution without user intent.

For each CAPEC or CWE included, provide a one‑line justification explaining exactly how it applies to this scenario.

Do not mix CAPECs and CWEs in the same category.
CAPEC = attacker behavior; CWE = system weakness.

End with a concise “final list” containing only:

the CAPECs and CWEs that are strictly necessary and non‑redundant.

Output format must be:

Assumed attack flow (bullet list)

the attacker’s strategy (distribution + deception + supply chain):

CAPEC‑X (name) — justification

the execution and impact:

CAPEC‑Y (name) — justification

the underlying trust failure:

CWE‑Z (name) — justification
