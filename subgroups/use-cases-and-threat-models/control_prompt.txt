I am performing threat modelling.

Threat Scenario

[INSERT THREAT SCENARIO TEXT HERE]

Associated Threat Patterns and Weaknesses

[INSERT CAPEC AND CWE LIST HERE]

Control Mapping Requirements

Map the above CAPECs and CWEs to mitigating security controls from a recognized control framework, specifically [CONTROL STANDARD AND VERSION, e.g., NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5].

For each control:

Use the official control identifier and control name from the selected standard

Provide a brief, one-sentence description of how the control mitigates the listed threats

Explicitly list the CAPEC(s) and/or CWE(s) mitigated by that control

Output Format (strict)
<Control ID and Name> – <brief description> – <CAPEC-ID(s) / CWE-ID(s) mitigated>
Constraints

Output only the list of controls in the specified format

Include only controls that directly and meaningfully mitigate the listed CAPECs and CWEs

Do not include generic, administrative, or unrelated controls

Do not include explanatory text, headings, or commentary outside the list
