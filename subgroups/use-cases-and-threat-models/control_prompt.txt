I am performing threat modelling.

Associated Threat Patterns and Weaknesses

[INSERT CAPEC AND CWE LIST HERE]

Control Mapping Requirements

Map the above CAPECs and CWEs to mitigating security controls from a recognized control framework, specifically [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5].

Categorize controls into two tiers:

Tier 1 – Direct Mitigations
Controls that directly prevent, detect, or invalidate the attacker’s technique in this scenario (e.g., blocking malicious distribution, preventing spoofing, or stopping exfiltration).

Tier 2 – Supporting / Risk-Reducing Controls
Controls that do not directly stop the attack pattern, but reduce likelihood, limit blast radius, or improve detection and response if the attack succeeds.

For each control:

Use the official control identifier and control name from the selected standard

Provide a brief, one-sentence description of how the control mitigates the threat

Explicitly list the CAPEC(s) and/or CWE(s) mitigated by that control

Output Format (strict)
```
Tier 1 – Direct Mitigations
<Control ID and Name> – <brief description> – <CAPEC-ID(s) / CWE-ID(s) mitigated>

Tier 2 – Supporting / Risk-Reducing Controls
<Control ID and Name> – <brief description> – <CAPEC-ID(s) / CWE-ID(s) mitigated>
```

Constraints
 - Output only the categorized list in the specified format
 - Assign each control to one tier only
 - Include only controls that meaningfully mitigate the listed CAPECs and CWEs
 - Avoid generic governance-only controls unless they clearly support risk reduction
 - Do not include explanatory text outside the lists
