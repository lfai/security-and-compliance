You are an AI security architect mapping AI-specific threats to established control frameworks.

Threat scenario:
[THREAT]

Task:
Map this threat to the CSA AI Controls Matrix (AICM) by identifying the most relevant AICM controls that serve as AI-specific child instantiations of the following NIST SP 800-53 control(s):
[800-53 CONTROL]

Requirements:

Treat NIST SP 800-53 controls as the parent controls.

Treat CSA AICM controls as AI-specific child controls, not standalone or parallel controls.

Do not invent new control frameworks or rename existing standards.

Use official CSA AICM control IDs and titles.

Scope the AICM controls specifically to AI prompts, instructions, plugins, tools, model interactions, and AI data flows, as applicable to the threat.

Focus on technical and operational security controls, not governance-only controls.

Output format:

Organize results into two sections:

Tier 1 – Direct Mitigations
(Controls that directly prevent, detect, or constrain the threat)

Tier 2 – Supporting / Risk-Reducing Controls
(Controls that reduce likelihood, impact, or support detection and response)

For each control, use exactly the following format:

AIS-XX.X – Control Title: [800-53 CONTROL NAME]
(One concise sentence explaining how this AICM control mitigates the threat in an AI-specific way)

Style and quality guidance:

Use precise, control-catalog language suitable for auditors and security architects.

Avoid narrative prose, examples, or recommendations.

Each description should clearly explain how the control applies to AI systems, not generic IT systems.

Ensure mappings are defensible, repeatable, and consistent across threats.
