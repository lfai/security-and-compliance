# Best Practices and Benchmarks for AI

AI technologies are becoming pervasive in our day-to-day activities and have potential to transform our lives and society. 
However, improper use of AI technologies pose significant risks that can negatively affect individuals, communities, and the world. 
This has led to the development of AI Risk Management Frameworks such as the NIST AI RMF and the EU Artificial Intelligence Act 
specifying a set of safeguards (controls) for responsible development and use of AI systems.

This initiative will create a whitepaper on best practices and benchmarks for AI platform and workloads and the related compliance artifacts. 
We will explore the NIST AI risk management framework with focus on developing best practices for AI risk assessment and compliance 
for AI workloads and  platforms. We will look at different aspects of AI risks around data, AI models, AI applications & runtime, 
and people & governance. We will then develop best practices and benchmarks for a generic AI platform.

**Who is the intended audience?**

This whitepaper is intended for teams and organizations developing AI workloads and platforms and interested in best practices for 
managing AI risks associated with them. We will look at various AI RMF such as the NIST Gen AI and EU AI Act and identify best practices 
for managing/mitigating those risks for AI systems. This whitepaper will specifically look at the NIST Gen AI RMF and identify benchmarks 
for handling those risks/controls in generic AI systems. As part of this effort we will also generate compliance artifacts such as 
AI catalog containing requirements/controls and component definitions giving best practices technology specific rules for any AI system.
