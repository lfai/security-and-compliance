### Mission statement

 <div style="background-color: #C8F0FF;">
 <p style="margin: 8px;">
  The Risk and Compliance Subgroup of the LF AI Security & Compliance Work Group addresses AI technologies and regulatory compliance in mission-critical environments. Our mission has two objectives: establishing secure AI production governance frameworks and leveraging AI to enhance organizational process governance. We implement compliance-as-code standards, contributing to and utilizing CNCF compliance and policy projects to build modular, interoperable AI compliance solutions. This creates a self-supporting cycle where robust governance ensures secure AI development and deployment, while AI-powered governance systems enhance compliance in regulated environments. Our vision is to establish a comprehensive, community-driven AI compliance approach that empowers organizations to deploy secure, trustworthy, auditable, and regulation-aligned AI systems, fostering innovation and cloud-native AI adoption.</p>
